"""The go2rtc stream gateway — one camera session, every consumer (W1).

go2rtc opens each network camera ONCE and fans it out: an RTSP restream on
localhost for the engine's decoder, and WebRTC for wall clients that want the
camera's own H.264 passed through with no re-encode. What it buys, in the
order that survived measurement (see tools/latency_baseline.py — the speed
case largely died on 8 Sep when single-threaded decode met the 300ms SLO over
plain MJPEG):

- cameras the current decoder cannot open at all (H.265 and assorted RTSP
  quirks — discovery.py already turns these away as `unsupported-codec`);
- H.264 passthrough to the Electron wall, shedding the per-frame JPEG encode
  on boxes where CPU is the whole complaint;
- reconnects and transport quirks handled by a tool whose only job that is.

Deliberately shaped like the Ollama vendoring (verification/ollama.py):
build scripts drop the binary at vendor/go2rtc/<platform>/, the spec copies
it into the frozen bundle, `go2rtc_binary()` resolves bundled-then-PATH, and
everything degrades loudly-but-safely to the direct decode path when the
binary is missing or the process dies — go2rtc is an upgrade, never a
requirement. Every listener binds 127.0.0.1: go2rtc's API has no auth, and
the house rule is that no unauthenticated route to a frame exists ("tokens on
every frame route"). Exposing WebRTC beyond this box is a deliberate later
step with the Electron work, not a default.
