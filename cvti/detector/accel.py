"""Detection rides the accelerator the box actually has (W2).

Shipped builds run CPU-torch while customer GPUs sit idle — the pilot's
Windows box has an iGPU that DirectML would use for near-free. Same YOLO
weights, exported once to ONNX at build time (scripts/export_onnx.py,
opset 17: the newest opset the shipping onnxruntime actually loads), run on
whatever accelerator exists. Parity is not hoped for, it is measured: the
exported model produced IDENTICAL boxes to torch on real footage (0.00px,
9 Sep spike), and tests/test_detection_rides_the_accelerator.py holds that.

The provider ladder, most-preferred first:

    DmlExecutionProvider        Windows iGPU/GPU (onnxruntime-directml)
    OpenVINOExecutionProvider   Intel CPU/iGPU (onnxruntime-openvino)
    CUDAExecutionProvider       NVIDIA (ultralytics selects this itself)
    CPUExecutionProvider        the floor — always works

CoreML is deliberately ABSENT: the 9 Sep spike showed onnxruntime's CoreML EP
partitions our dynamic-batch graph and fails at runtime — and the Mac never
needed it, torch-MPS already runs 2.7x there. Dev Macs keep torch; the ONNX
path exists for the boxes customers actually run.

Everything degrades to torch, loudly: no onnxruntime, no .onnx beside the
weights, a corrupt export, or the site saying `"detector_backend": "torch"` —
each lands on exactly today's path with the reason carried into health. An
accelerator is an upgrade, never a requirement (the go2rtc rule, again).

One deliberate transgression, fenced: ultralytics builds its ONNX provider
list internally and knows CUDA, CoreML, and CPU — nothing else. To get
DirectML/OpenVINO in front we wrap its backend's load_model and, when the
session came up CPU-only while a better provider is available, rebuild that
session. ultralytics is PINNED (requirements.txt); a version bump that moves
this seam fails the pin test rather than silently dropping the accelerator.
