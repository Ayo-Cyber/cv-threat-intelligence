"""Camera tamper / block detection — pure CV, no model, near-zero cost.

A blocked or sabotaged camera is a threat in itself (covering the lens is a
common first move). Two cheap signals catch the common cases:

  • blackout  — mean brightness collapses (lens covered, spray-painted, bag over
                it, or the feed cut to black)
  • obscured  — image sharpness collapses while it's still bright (defocused,
                smeared, fogged, or a translucent cover)

We learn a slow rolling baseline of brightness + sharpness while the scene looks
normal, and fire when the current value drops well below that baseline for a few
consecutive frames. Baseline only adapts when normal, so gradual lighting drift
doesn't false-fire but a sudden cover does. One alert per episode (latched until
the view recovers).
